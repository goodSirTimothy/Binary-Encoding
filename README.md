# Binary-Encoding
This takes text input and converts that input into a binary string. It does not use ASCII code so it can be customized.
<br>
After getting the binary values, the program changes the binary 1's and 0's too random numbers between 0 and 9 (explained more in [Quick Guide](https://github.com/goodSirTimothy/Binary-Encoding/blob/master/README.md#encoding-program-quick-guide)) 
<br>
<br>

# Extra Information
This was designed for one of my YouTube channels. And in the video, I claimed that it was encryption, but a friend pointed out later (a lot later) that it was actually encoding and not encryption. Because the video shows the application in use, I have decided to leave the video included with the GitHub README. 
<br>
<br>

# Help
For a quick reference on how the program works after downloaded the project. Check out [encoding Program Quick Guide.txt](https://github.com/goodSirTimothy/Binary-Encoding/blob/master/src/Encryption%20Program%20Quick%20Guid.txt) (it has all the same information as the quick guide on here, just doesn't look as nice).

  <summary>Concept</summary>
  <p>Set A-z to binary strings.</p>
  <p>Then use those strings as the base of the random numbers.</p>
  <p>IF 0, number should be 0 <= x <= 4</p>
  <p>IF 1, number should be 5 <= x <= 9</p>

  <summary>Other Notes</summary>
  <p>If you want to add more values to the encoder, place a 0 to all old binary statements</p>
  <p>For example,<br>*=64 Binary = 1000000<br>that would mean that<br>A=10 Binary = 0000001 instead of 000001<br>It's one more '0'. Hard to see but could cause hours of time debugging your code.</p>
